  <p>Your Reliable AI Dispensing Machine</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>I believe that most of us must have experienced the impatience for waiting so long just for some mild and simple drugs. Actually in the Specialist Clinic Pharmacy of the Prince of Wales Hospital, there are only 20 staff, but they have to handle around a thousand and six hundred prescriptions every day. Such excessive workload has led to discontentment of the patient. Think about the fast food store, McDonald's. If customers are waiting so long, and not enough staff are handling orders, the restaurant will soon collapse. Not wanting it to happen in the healthcare system, we introduce the AI dispensing machine. We call it Meddonald, starting by M E D.</p>
  <p>This AI model is trained based on reliable pharmacological sources such as the British National Formulary or TouchMed (e藥通). It will learn to match the indications of each drug with its mechanism to identify any medical risk. Then, further verification can be checked by professional pharmacists.</p>

      <h3>Prescription Verification</h3>
      <p>The verification of prescriptions aims to minimize medication errors, including wrong drug orders, potential allergies, and overdose risks. Using labeled patient files as input data, deep learning algorithm like deep neural network can be used to predict the most suitable and safer medication for the patient.</p>

      <h3>Dispensing and Packing</h3>
      <p>For the automation of drugs packing in the pharmacy, IoT devices can be incorporated into the process. Sensors can be added to detect and monitor the inventory level of all the drugs, and cameras can be used to perform error-checking of the AI dispenser.</p>

  <p>We hope that by using Meddonald in hospitals, patients can get their medication within 5 to 10 minutes, just like ordering from McDonald's. No more wasted time in the pharmacy. Thank you.</p>
